Typically, I would dismiss the movie as boring, pointless, and part of the ongoing scummy tactics from Disney to cash checks without actually making new material. Comparing this to Aladdin (another mirror remake, although one with around 40 minutes of unnecessary new material), I must admit I found myself drawn in and emotionally captivated; credit the entire cast (they walk the line between mimicking the performances that came before them and occasionally making the role their own) and the special effects department that have essentially used computers to render lifelike animals. The Lion King goes beyond the uncanny valley; if you told me the filmmakers trained real animals to do all of this I would probably believe you out of nothing more than utter disbelief at the technological prowess on display. Far more freakishly stunning is that the movie is surprisingly expressive with a decent amount of color. Itâ€™s nowhere near as vibrant as the animated version, but for a much darker tone (the most noticeable change is that outside of Timon and Pumbaa, there is not much comedy here, and that includes the no-nonsense hyenas) it still flourishes with beautiful aesthetics. They can be inconsistent from time to time (there are definitely some scenes that look much blander than the rest of the gorgeous craftsmanship), but the film has got to be a lock for the visual effects Oscar.
